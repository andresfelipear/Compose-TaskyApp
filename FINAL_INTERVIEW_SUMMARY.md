## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I'm an Android developer focused on modern Kotlin development. I built **Tasky**, an offline-first agenda app using **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Room, and Coroutines**—exactly Neo's stack.

What makes it production-ready is the **offline-first architecture** where users can create, update, and delete items without connectivity, with intelligent background sync using WorkManager. I follow **Clean Architecture** with feature-based modules, implement **centralized navigation** for testability, and have **90+ unit tests** covering ViewModels, repositories, and business logic.

The app handles real-world challenges like conflict resolution, exact alarm scheduling for notifications, process death recovery, and cross-device sync. I'm excited about Neo because you're building something that matters for Canadians, and I'd love to contribute with my experience in building scalable, testable Android apps."

## Top 10 Interview Questions & Quick Answers

### 1. What's your approach to app architecture?

> "Clean Architecture organized by feature, with Data/Domain/Presentation layers. In Tasky, each feature like 'auth' and 'agenda' is self-contained. I use MVVM with MVI elements for state management."

### 2. How do you manage state in Compose?

> "Unidirectional data flow with StateFlow for persistent state, Channel for one-time events, and sealed interfaces for actions. I use WhileSubscribed(5000) to survive configuration changes."

### 3. Explain your use of Coroutines and Flows.

> "ViewModelScope for UI operations, application scope for background work. I use flatMapLatest for switching data streams, combine for merging flows, and proper dispatcher management with DispatcherProvider abstraction."

### 4. How do you handle dependency injection?

> "Dagger Hilt with feature-specific modules. I use @Named qualifiers for multiple bindings (authenticated vs unauthenticated OkHttpClient), and leverage Hilt's ViewModelworker and integration."

### 5. How do you ensure code quality?

> "Type-safe sealed interfaces, immutable state, dependency injection for testability, structured logging with Timber, and comprehensive unit tests with 90+ tests covering edge cases."

### 6. How do you handle offline scenarios?

> "Offline-first architecture. All data served from Room database first for instant response. Local changes queued in PendingItemSyncEntity table, synced via WorkManager with exponential backoff retry logic."

### 7. How do you approach testing?

> "Multi-level testing with fakes (not mocks) for better maintainability. 90+ unit tests covering ViewModels, repositories, and business logic. Focus on edge cases like offline scenarios, rapid user actions, and error handling."

### 8. Explain your navigation architecture.

> "Centralized navigation where screens emit NavigationEvents through callbacks. MainActivity handles all actual navigation in one place. Makes screens testable without mocking NavController."

### 9. How do you handle background work?

> "WorkManager for reliable sync with network constraints and exponential backoff. AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle for notifications that work in Doze mode. Dedicated workers for each operation type."

### 10. How do you handle configuration changes?

> "ViewModel survives rotation automatically. SavedStateHandle for critical UI state. WhileSubscribed(5000) gives 5-second grace period. Encrypted DataStore for session data."

### Team & Process

5. "What does the code review process look like?"
6. "How do Android, iOS, and backend teams collaborate?"
7. "How do you use GitHub Copilot in the team?"
8. "What's the onboarding process for new Android developers?"

### Growth

9. "What are the biggest technical challenges the Android team is facing?"
10. "Is there dedicated time for learning new technologies?"

## Code to Demo in Interview

**If they ask to see code, show these:**

### 1. Centralized Navigation (MainActivity.kt - line 172)

```kotlin
private fun handleNavigationEvent(
    event: NavigationEvent,
    navController: NavHostController
) {
    when(event) {
        is NavigationEvent.NavigateToAgenda -> {
            navController.navigate(AgendaRoute) {
                popUpTo(AuthGraph) { inclusive = true }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. State Management (AgendaViewModel.kt - line 45)

```kotlin
val state = _state
    .onStart {
        loadInitialData()
        observeSelectedDateChanges()
    }
    .stateIn(
        scope = viewModelScope,
        started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000),
        initialValue = _state.value
    )
```

### 3. Offline-First (OfflineFirstAgendaRepository.kt)

```kotlin
override suspend fun createAgendaItem(agendaItem: AgendaItem): EmptyResult<DataError> {
    // Save locally first (instant feedback)
    localAgendaSource.insertAgendaItem(agendaItem)
    scheduleReminder(agendaItem)

    // Queue background sync
    applicationScope.launch {
        syncAgendaScheduler.scheduleSyncAgenda(
            syncType = SyncAgendaScheduler.SyncType.CreateItem(agendaItem)
        )
    }

    return Result.Success(Unit)
}
```

### 4. Testing (LoginViewModelTest.kt)

```kotlin
@Test
fun `when login succeeds, success event is emitted`() = runTest {
    val events = mutableListOf<LoginScreenEvent>()
    val job = launch {
        viewModel.event.collect { events.add(it) }
    }

    viewModel.onAction(LoginScreenAction.OnLogin)
    advanceUntilIdle()

    assertTrue(events.any { it is LoginScreenEvent.Success })
    job.cancel()
}
```
