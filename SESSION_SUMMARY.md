### 🏗️ 2. Architecture Improvements

**Centralized Navigation Pattern (Refactored All 6 Screens)**

- ✅ Created `NavigationEvent.kt` - Type-safe navigation events
- ✅ Centralized `handleNavigationEvent()` in MainActivity

## Key Patterns Implemented & Documented

### 1. ScreenRoot + Screen Separation

**Why:** Testability, preview support, reusability
**Example:** LoginScreen.kt lines 46-89 (Root) and 92-199 (Screen)

### 2. ObserveAsEvents

**Why:** One-time events without duplicates
**Example:** All ScreenRoot files

### 3. .onStart{}.stateIn()

**Why:** Lazy init, survives config changes
**Example:** AgendaViewModel.kt lines 37-58

### 4. Centralized Navigation

**Why:** Testability, maintainability, analytics
**Example:** MainActivity.kt lines 172-229

### 5. Offline-First Architecture

**Why:** Instant UX, works offline, reliable sync
**Example:** OfflineFirstAgendaRepository.kt

### 6. Comprehensive Testing

**Why:** Quality assurance, confidence, documentation
**Example:** 90+ tests across all test files

## Your Talking Points

### Opening

> "I built Tasky to demonstrate production-ready Android development with Kotlin, Compose, and modern architecture patterns. It features offline-first capabilities, comprehensive testing with 90+ unit tests, and follows best practices like centralized navigation and clean architecture."

### On Architecture

> "I follow Clean Architecture with feature-based modules. Each feature has clear Data/Domain/Presentation layers, uses MVVM with MVI patterns for state management, and leverages Hilt for dependency injection."

### On Testing (NEW!)

> "Testing is core to my development process. Tasky has 90+ unit tests covering ViewModels, repositories, and business logic. I use fake implementations instead of mocks for better maintainability and test realistic scenarios including edge cases."

### On Modern Patterns

> "I implement centralized navigation for testability, use ObserveAsEvents for one-time event handling, and apply .onStart{}.stateIn() with WhileSubscribed for configuration-change-resistant state management."

### On Offline-First

> "The offline-first architecture ensures instant user feedback. All operations save locally first, then sync in the background via WorkManager with retry logic. Users can create, update, delete items without connectivity."

### On Growth Mindset

> "While I haven't used GraphQL yet, I'm excited to learn it. My experience with Retrofit and understanding of reactive patterns with Flow will transfer well. I'm always learning—for Tasky, I deepened my knowledge of WorkManager, Flow operators, and testing patterns."
