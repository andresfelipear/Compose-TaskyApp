## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

_"I'm an Android developer focused on modern Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I built **Tasky**, an offline-first agenda app using Kotlin, Compose, Hilt, Room, and Coroutines—matching Neo's stack perfectly._

_What makes it production-ready is the offline-first architecture where users can create items without connectivity, with intelligent background sync. I follow Clean Architecture with feature modules, centralized navigation for testability, and have 80+ unit tests with edge case coverage._

_I've solved real-world challenges like conflict resolution, exact alarm scheduling, and cross-device sync. I'm excited about Neo's mission to build better financial futures for Canadians and ready to contribute day one."_

---

## Top 5 Strengths to Emphasize

### 1. Perfect Stack Match ✅

"I use exactly Neo's stack—Kotlin, Compose, Hilt, Coroutines. I can contribute day one."

### 2. Production-Ready Features 🏗️

"Tasky isn't a tutorial app—it has offline-first architecture, background sync with WorkManager, JWT auth with refresh tokens, and exact alarm scheduling."

### 3. Modern Best Practices 🎯

"I implement centralized navigation for testability, ObserveAsEvents for one-time events, and .onStart{}.stateIn() for configuration-resistant state management."

### 4. Comprehensive Testing 🧪

"I have 80+ unit tests with fake implementations, edge case coverage, and proper coroutine testing. Tests prove the architecture is testable and maintainable."

### 5. Architectural Thinking 🏛️

"I follow Clean Architecture with feature-based modules, clear layer separation, and dependency injection throughout. The codebase scales well for team environments."
