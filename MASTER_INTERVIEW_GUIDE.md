## 30-Second Pitch

"I'm an Android developer with a focus on modern Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I built **Tasky**, an offline-first agenda app using **Kotlin, Compose, Hilt, Room, and Coroutines**â€”matching Neo's stack perfectly.

The app features **offline-first architecture** with background sync, **90+ unit tests** with edge case coverage, **Clean Architecture** with feature modules, and **centralized navigation** for testability.

I've solved real-world challenges like conflict resolution, exact alarm scheduling, and cross-device sync. I'm excited about Neo's mission to build better financial futures for Canadians and ready to contribute day one."

---

## Tasky Overview

**What:** Offline-first agenda management app (events, tasks, reminders)

**Tech Stack:**

- 100% Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose + Material 3
- Hilt for DI
- Room (5 migrations)
- Retrofit + OkHttp
- Coroutines + Flow
- WorkManager
- Encrypted DataStore

**Key Features:**

- Offline-first with background sync
- JWT auth with refresh tokens
- Exact alarms (Doze-compatible)
- Cross-device sync
- 90+ unit tests

---

## Top 10 Q&A

### 1. What's your approach to app architecture?

**Quick Answer:**

> "Clean Architecture organized by feature. Each feature (auth, agenda) has Data/Domain/Presentation layers. I use MVVM with MVI elements for state management."

**Key Points:**

- Feature-based modules (auth/, agenda/, core/)
- Three layers: Presentation â†’ Domain â†’ Data
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- ViewModels expose StateFlow for state, Channel for events
- Sealed interfaces for type safety

**Code:** `AgendaViewModel.kt` lines 37-58

---

### 2. How do you manage state in Compose?

**Quick Answer:**

> "Unidirectional data flow: StateFlow for persistent state, Channel for one-time events, sealed interfaces for actions. Use WhileSubscribed(5000) to survive rotation."

**Key Points:**

- Single immutable `ViewState` data class
- `StateFlow` with `WhileSubscribed(5000)`
- `Channel` â†’ `Flow` for one-time events
- Actions as sealed interfaces
- `update {}` for safe state mutations

**Code:** `AgendaScreenState.kt`, `AgendaViewModel.kt`

---

### 3. Explain Coroutines and Flows.

**Quick Answer:**

> "ViewModelScope for UI operations, application scope for background work. Use flatMapLatest for switching streams, combine for merging, and proper dispatcher management."

**Key Points:**

- `viewModelScope` for UI-related work
- `applicationScope` for operations beyond ViewModel
- `flatMapLatest` for switching data streams
- `combine` for merging multiple Flows
- `DispatcherProvider` for testability

**Code:** `AgendaViewModel.kt` lines 222-245 (flatMapLatest)

---

### 4. How do you handle dependency injection?

**Quick Answer:**

> "Dagger Hilt with feature modules. Use @Named qualifiers for multiple bindings, @Singleton for app-lifetime dependencies, and leverage Hilt's ViewModel/WorkManager integration."

**Key Points:**

- Module per feature (`TaskyAgendaModule`, `AppModule`)
- @Named for qualified bindings (authenticated/unauthenticated OkHttp)
- Interface â†’ Implementation binding
- @HiltViewModel, @HiltWorker integration

**Code:** `TaskyAgendaModule.kt`, `AppModule.kt`

---

### 5. How do you ensure code quality?

**Quick Answer:**

> "Type-safe sealed interfaces, immutable state, dependency injection, comprehensive testing (90+ tests), and structured logging."

**Key Points:**

- Sealed interfaces for compile-time safety
- Immutable data classes with `copy()`
- DI for testability
- 90+ unit tests with edge cases
- Timber for structured logging
- Fakes over mocks

**Code:** All test files

---

### 6. How do you handle offline scenarios?

**Quick Answer:**

> "Offline-first: Room database serves all data first. Local changes queued in PendingItemSyncEntity, synced via WorkManager with retry logic."

**Key Points:**

- Local-first data access (instant response)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Pending sync queue
- WorkManager with exponential backoff
- Periodic fetch every 30 minutes
- Backend as source of truth

**Code:** `OfflineFirstAgendaRepository.kt`

---

### 7. How do you approach testing? (NEW!)

**Quick Answer:**

> "Multi-level testing with fakes for maintainability. 90+ unit tests covering ViewModels, repositories, and business logic. Focus on edge cases."

**Key Points:**

- 20+ tests for LoginViewModel
- 25+ tests for AgendaViewModel
- 25+ tests for InputValidator
- 20+ tests for Repository
- Fakes instead of mocks
- Edge case coverage (empty, unicode, concurrent)

**Code:** `LoginViewModelTest.kt`, `InputValidatorImplTest.kt`

---

### 8. Explain your navigation architecture.

**Quick Answer:**

> "Centralized navigation: screens emit NavigationEvents via callback. MainActivity handles all navigation in one place. Makes screens testable without NavController."

**Key Points:**

- NavigationEvent sealed interface
- `handleNavigationEvent()` in MainActivity
- Screens receive `onNavigate: (NavigationEvent) -> Unit`
- Hybrid pattern for savedStateHandle
- Easy to add analytics

**Code:** `MainActivity.kt` lines 172-229

---

### 9. How do you handle background work?

**Quick Answer:**

> "WorkManager for sync (network constraints, exponential backoff). AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle for notifications in Doze mode."

**Key Points:**

- Dedicated workers per operation (Create/Update/Delete)
- Network constraints for battery efficiency
- Exponential backoff retry
- Exact alarms for timely notifications
- RescheduleAlarmWorker after reboot

**Code:** `CreateAgendaItemWorker.kt`, `AlarmManagerAlarmScheduler.kt`

---

### 10. How do you handle configuration changes?

**Quick Answer:**

> "ViewModel survives rotation automatically. SavedStateHandle for UI state. WhileSubscribed(5000) gives 5s grace period. DataStore for session."

**Key Points:**

- ViewModel automatic survival
- SavedStateHandle for process death
- `WhileSubscribed(5000)` prevents restart during rotation
- Encrypted DataStore for auth tokens
- Room for all user data

**Code:** `AgendaViewModel.kt` lines 44-46

---

## Testing Approach

### Philosophy

> "I write tests for everything with business logic. Tests aren't just happy pathâ€”I focus on edge cases like offline scenarios, empty inputs, concurrent operations."

### What's Tested (90+ Tests)

- **ViewModels** (45+ tests)

  - State management
  - Event emission
  - Error handling
  - User flows

- **Repositories** (20+ tests)

  - Offline-first behavior
  - Data synchronization
  - Error fallback

- **Business Logic** (25+ tests)
  - Input validation
  - Edge cases
  - Boundary conditions

### Why Fakes Over Mocks

> "Fakes behave like real implementations and are reusable. My FakeAgendaRepository actually emits Flow updates just like Room would."

### Example Test

```kotlin
@Test
fun `when login succeeds, success event is emitted`() = runTest {
    val events = mutableListOf<LoginScreenEvent>()
    val job = launch {
        viewModel.event.collect { events.add(it) }
    }

    viewModel.onAction(LoginScreenAction.OnLogin)
    advanceUntilIdle()

    assertTrue(events.any { it is LoginScreenEvent.Success })
    job.cancel()
}
```

## 4 Key Patterns

### Pattern 1: ScreenRoot + Screen

```kotlin
// Root - Stateful (ViewModel, events)
@Composable
fun LoginScreenRoot(
    viewModel: LoginViewModel = hiltViewModel(),
    onNavigate: (NavigationEvent) -> Unit
) {
    val state by viewModel.state.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    LoginScreen(onAction = viewModel::onAction, state = state)
}

// Screen - Stateless (pure UI)
@Composable
fun LoginScreen(
    onAction: (LoginScreenAction) -> Unit,
    state: LoginScreenState
) {
    // Pure UI - can preview!
}
```

### Pattern 2: ObserveAsEvents

```kotlin
ObserveAsEvents(viewModel.event) { event ->
    when(event) {
        is LoginScreenEvent.Success -> {
            onNavigate(NavigationEvent.NavigateToAgenda)
        }
    }
}
```

### Pattern 3: .onStart{}.stateIn()

```kotlin
val state = _state
    .onStart {
        loadInitialData()
        observePasswordText()
    }
    .stateIn(
        scope = viewModelScope,
        started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000),
        initialValue = _state.value
    )
```

### Pattern 4: Centralized Navigation

```kotlin
// MainActivity
private fun handleNavigationEvent(
    event: NavigationEvent,
    navController: NavHostController
) {
    when(event) {
        is NavigationEvent.NavigateToAgenda -> {
            navController.navigate(AgendaRoute) {
                popUpTo(AuthGraph) { inclusive = true }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
