## Technical Architecture

Tasky employs a clean, layered architecture organized primarily by **feature**, with a clear separation of concerns within each feature using a **layered approach**. This combines the benefits of **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for UI state management and reactive data flows, with elements reminiscent of **MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** for handling user actions and one-time events.

### Project Structure (Package by Feature)

The application is modularized based on its core functionalities. Each top-level feature module encapsulates its own data, domain, and presentation logic, promoting maintainability and scalability.

### Layered Architecture within Features

Within each feature, a standard layered architecture is applied:

1.  **Presentation Layer:**

      * **Composables (Views):** These are your Jetpack Compose UI elements (screens and reusable components). They are responsible for rendering the UI based on the `ViewState` and dispatching user interactions (`UserAction`) to the ViewModel.
      * **ViewModels:** These hold and manage the UI state (`ViewState`) for the corresponding screen. They expose this state to the Composables via `StateFlow` or `LiveData`. They contain the business logic related to UI interactions and interact directly with the **Domain Layer's Repositories**.
      * **Sealed Interface for User Actions (`UserAction` / `Event`):** User interactions (e.g., button clicks, text input changes) are modeled as events (often a sealed interface, e.g., `LoginEvent`, `RegistrationAction`). The Composables collect these actions and pass them to the ViewModel for processing, giving the ViewModel a "presenter"-like role in handling input.
      * **Sealed Interface for One-Time View Events (`Effect` / `UiEvent`):** The ViewModel communicates one-time events (e.g., navigation commands, showing a SnackBar, displaying a Toast) back to the View via a separate mechanism (e.g., a `SharedFlow` or `Channel`). These events are typically consumed once by the View and do not represent persistent UI state.
      * **Data Class for View State (`ViewState` / `ScreenState`):** The ViewModel exposes the current state of the UI as a simple data class (e.g., `LoginState`, `AgendaState`). This data class contains all the necessary properties (loading indicators, error messages, data to display) that the Composable needs to render itself.

2.  **Domain Layer:**

      * This layer is platform-independent and focuses on the core business rules and entities. It contains:
          * **Repository Interfaces:** Define contracts for data operations (e.g., `AgendaRepository`, `AuthRepository`) that the Data Layer must implement. These interfaces are directly consumed by the Presentation Layer's ViewModels.
          * **Domain Models:** Pure Kotlin data classes representing the core entities of the application (e.g., `AgendaItem`, `Attendee`, `AlarmItem`).

3.  **Data Layer:**

      * Responsible for providing data to the Domain Layer. It contains:
          * **Repository Implementations:** Implement the interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. They decide whether to fetch data from local or remote sources. (e.g., `AgendaRepositoryImpl`).
          * **Data Sources:** Handle direct interaction with local (Room database) and remote (API via Retrofit/OkHttp) data (e.g., `LocalAgendaDataSource`, `RemoteAgendaDataSource`).
          * **Mappers:** Convert data between network/database entities and domain models.

## Offline-First Design

A cornerstone of Tasky's architecture is its robust offline-first strategy, ensuring a smooth user experience regardless of network connectivity.

  * **Local Data Source (`Room` Database):** All agenda items (Events, Tasks, Reminders) are persistently stored in a local Room database. This allows the app to function fully, including CRUD operations, when offline.
  * **Remote Data Source (API):** Interacts with the backend API for synchronization.
  * **`OfflineFirstAgendaRepository`:** This central component orchestrates data flow.
      * It always serves data from the local database first, ensuring immediate responsiveness.
      * It manages sending local changes to the remote and periodically fetching updates from the remote.
  * **Background Synchronization with `WorkManager`:**
      * **Pending Sync Queue:** Local changes (create, update, delete operations) are first saved to a `PendingItemSyncEntity` in the local database.
      * **Dedicated Workers:** `WorkManager` is heavily utilized to handle synchronization:
          * `CreateAgendaItemWorker`, `UpdateAgendaItemWorker`, `DeleteAgendaItemWorker`: Dedicated workers for each type of local modification, configured with `setBackoffCriteria` for robust retries. These workers process items from the pending sync queue when connectivity is available.
          * `PeriodicFetchAgendaWorker`: Periodically (e.g., every 30 minutes) fetches the latest agenda items from the backend to ensure local data is up-to-date, including items added by other devices or users adding the current user as an attendee.
      * **Conflict Resolution:** The system is designed to prioritize the most recent state where applicable, relying on the backend for the "source of truth" upon successful synchronization.
  * **Login/Logout Handling:** Upon successful login, the app fetches all user-specific agenda items from the backend. Upon logout, local user data is cleared, and associated reminders are cancelled.

  * **Splash Screen:** [Android 12+ Splash Screen API](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen)

## API Interaction

Tasky interacts with a custom backend API to manage agenda items and user authentication.

  * **Base URL:** `https://tasky.pl-coding.com/`
  * **Authentication:**
      * All endpoints require an `x-api-key` header.
      * Uses **Refresh Token Authentication** with JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions. The app handles the entire authentication flow:
          * User registration creates a long-lived refresh token.
          * Login provides an `accessToken` (short-lived) and `refreshToken` (long-lived).
          * The `SessionStorage` is responsible for securely storing and providing session tokens.
          * Access token refresh logic is handled to ensure continuous authenticated API calls.
  * **Endpoints:**
      * **Auth:** `/register`, `/login`, `/refreshToken`
      * **Agenda:** `/agenda` (for fetching all items for a given day)
      * **Events:** `/event` (Create, Update, Delete, Get by ID), `/event?eventId={eventId}` (Delete)
          * Supports `hostId` for ownership and `attendees` management.
      * **Tasks:** `/task` (Create, Update, Delete, Get by ID), `/task?taskId={taskId}` (Delete)
          * *Note: API does not return `hostId` for Tasks, ownership is inferred by user session.*
      * **Reminders:** `/reminder` (Create, Update, Delete, Get by ID), `/reminder?reminderId={reminderId}` (Delete)
          * *Note: API does not return `hostId` for Reminders, ownership is inferred by user session.*
      * **Photos:** `/photo` (Upload, Delete) - part of Event management.

## Requirements

The application adheres to the following key requirements:

  * **Responsiveness:** Supports both mobile devices and tablets, including landscape mode.
  * **Theming:** Fully supports both light and dark themes.
  * **Splash Screen:** Displays a splash screen during app launch to check for active user sessions.
  * **Notification Reliability:** Alarms are set using `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` to ensure timely delivery, even in Doze mode.
  * **Cross-Device Sync:** Changes made on one device are synced and reflected on others where the user is logged in.
  * **Data Integrity:** Proper sync order is maintained to ensure the backend reflects the most up-to-date state.
  * **Background Check:** The app checks for new agenda items from the backend at least every 30 minutes.
